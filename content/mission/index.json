  "description": "At Rapid Flow Fulfillment, our mission is simple: to deliver the kind of prep and logistics service we always wished we had as sellers. After years of dealing with unreliable, slow, and overpriced fulfillment centers while running our own e-commerce business, we knew the industry needed a serious upgrade. That’s why we built Rapid Flow — a fulfillment solution created by sellers, for sellers. Our goal is to bring speed, transparency, and true partnership back to the 3PL experience, helping e-commerce brands grow by handling their backend operations with the same care and urgency we gave our own.\n"
